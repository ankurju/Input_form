# Input_form
A very basic and simple input form that is made using custom hooks in React.
I have made two custom hooks. First using useState hook and second using useReducer.
However, this is not the actual use case of useReducer because useReducer is used to manage more complex state i.e,
when a lot of related pieces of state or data is managed in individual state, then we use useReducer generally.
